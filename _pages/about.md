I am broadly interested in the intersection of physics and machine learning.
My work encompasses LLMs for time series, playing with SDEs to improve diffusion model performance, ML chemical potentials, and inverse problems.


Biography
====

I am a postdoctoral researcher investigating the intersection of Physics, Chemistry, and AI with [Michael Mahoney](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~mmahoney/) and [Benjamin Erichson](https://www.benerichson.com/). 
I have a joint appointment at the [Berkeley Statistics department](https://statistics.berkeley.edu/), [Lawrence Berkeley National Lab](https://www.lbl.gov/), and the [International Computer Science Institute](https://www.icsi.berkeley.edu/icsi/). 
I am also an affiliate at [SLAC National Lab](https://www6.slac.stanford.edu/).
I recieved my Physics PhD from Stanford in 2023 under the mentorship of [Phil Bucksbaum](https://physics.stanford.edu/people/philip-bucksbaum) and [Ryan Coffee](https://profiles.stanford.edu/ryan-coffee) where I researched excited state quantum molecular dynamics through [ultrafast gas-phase diffraction](https://lcls.slac.stanford.edu/instruments/mev-ued). 
For my [dissertation](https://www.proquest.com/openview/b0faf8c1ab75235805be040f23ea621e/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=18750&diss=y), I applied theoretical physics, statistics, and fundamental machine learning techniques to invert the measured diffraction patterns for molecular frame structure probability distributions, addressing a 50 year-old inverse problem.
During the summer of 2019 I interned at Google X as an AI Research Fellow where I worked in the [blushift team](https://research.google/teams/blueshift/) using adversarial examples to probe fundamental properties between disparate neural network architectures.

I recieved an Honors B.Sc from the University of Michigan where I majored in Physics and Math.
Here, I researched High Energy Particle Physics at CERN with [Bing Zhou](https://lsa.umich.edu/physics/people/faculty/bzhou.html).
My [research](https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/107730/khegazy.pdf;sequence=1) focused on the discovery of the Higgs Boson and measuring its spin.
