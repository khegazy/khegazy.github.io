I am a postdoc researcher investigating the intersection of Physics, Chemistry, and AI with [Michael Mahoney](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~mmahoney/) and [Benjamin Erichson](https://www.benerichson.com/). 
I have a joint appointment at the [Berkeley Statistics department](https://statistics.berkeley.edu/), [Lawrence Berkeley National Lab](https://www.lbl.gov/), and the [International Computer Science Institute](https://www.icsi.berkeley.edu/icsi/). 
I am also an affiliate at [SLAC National Lab](https://www6.slac.stanford.edu/).
I recieved my Physics PhD from Stanford in 2023 under the mentorship of [Phil Bucksbaum](https://physics.stanford.edu/people/philip-bucksbaum) and [Ryan Coffee](https://profiles.stanford.edu/ryan-coffee) where I researched excited state molecular dynamics through [ultrafast gas-phase diffraction](https://lcls.slac.stanford.edu/instruments/mev-ued). 
For my [dissertation](https://www.proquest.com/openview/b0faf8c1ab75235805be040f23ea621e/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=18750&diss=y), I used theoretical physics, statistics, and fundamental machine learning to invert the measured diffraction patterns for molecular frame structure, addressing a 50 year-old inverse problem.
During the summer of 2019 I interned at Google X as an AI Research Fellow where I worked in the [blushift team](https://research.google/teams/blueshift/) where we used adversarial examples to probe fundamental properties between different nerual network architectures.

I recieved an Honors B.Sc from the University of Michigan where I majored in Physics and Math.
I researched High Energy Particle Physics at CERN with [Bing Zhou](https://lsa.umich.edu/physics/people/faculty/bzhou.html).
My [research](https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/107730/khegazy.pdf;sequence=1) focused on the discover of the Higgs Boson and determining its spin.
